The ACClab is a cognitive neuroscience research lab led by Nick Yeung at the University of Oxford.
This github aims to collate the work, documentation, and collaboration of the lab group and extended members. 

Individual projects, example code snippets, and internal documents are housed in specific repositories - where possible we use tags to signal what work is present in each repository. 
Each repository will also be created with a README to help orient navigation of the code and documentation that it houses.
